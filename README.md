# Java Stock Prices Client

This is a demonstration project made up of two modules: a Java client and a JavaFX user interface.

The Java client connects via REST (Representational State Transfer) or RSocket to the back-end Kotlin [stock-service](https://github.com/borrelunde/stock-service) which streams randomly generated prices for it. While a JavaFX user interface displays the updating prices continuously on a line chart.

The project is following an [IntelliJ IDEA tutorial](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/12/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot/) that shows how to build Reactive applications with Kotlin, Spring, Java and JavaFX.
